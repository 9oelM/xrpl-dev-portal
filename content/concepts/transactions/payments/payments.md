# Payment Types

- **[Direct XRP Payments](direct-xrp-payments.md)** send XRP directly from one account to another in the XRP Ledger.

- **[Cross-Currency Payments](cross-currency-payments.md)** convert one currency to another through paths and order books before sending it to a recipient.

- **[Checks](checks.md)** create deferred payments that can be canceled or cashed by the intended recipients.

- **[Escrow](escrow.md)** set aside XRP and deliver it after certain conditions are met. Escrows can depend on time limits, cryptographic conditions, or both.

- **[Partial Payments](partial-payments.md)** subtract fees from the amount to send before delivering it. They're useful for returning unwanted payments without incurring additional costs.

- **[Payment Channels](payment-channels.md)** enable fast, asynchronous XRP payments that can be divided into small increments and settled later.
