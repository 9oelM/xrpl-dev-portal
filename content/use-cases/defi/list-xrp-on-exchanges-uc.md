# List XRP on Other Exchanges

Custodial exchanges hold funds on behalf of users and allow them to deposit, withdraw, and trade digital assets, fiat currencies, or other types of assets. Listing XRP on custodial exchanges can benefit their users by enabling them to:
  
  - Deposit XRP *to* the exchange *from* the XRP Ledger.
  - Withdraw XRP *from* the exchange *to* the XRP Ledger.
  - Trade XRP with currencies not available on the XRP Ledger.

To get started with listing XRP, see: [List XRP as an Exchange](list-xrp-as-an-exchange.html).
