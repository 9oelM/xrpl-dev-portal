# Cross-currency Payments

The XRP Ledger enables you to make cross-currency payments of XRP and tokens. In the XRP Ledger, you can send cross-currency payments that exchange tokens, XRP, or both. Like [direct XRP payments](direct-xrp-payments.html), these payments use the `Payment transaction` type. Cross-currency payments within the XRP Ledger are fully atomic, meaning that either the payment fully executes or no part of it executes.

By default, cross-currency payments deliver a fixed amount to their destination at a variable cost to their source. Cross-currency payments can also be [partial payments](partial-payments.md), which deliver a variable amount to the destination within a fixed sending limit.

Learn about [Cross-currency Payments](cross-currency-payments.html) on the XRP Ledger.
