# Cross-currency Payments

The XRP Ledger enables you to make cross-currency payments of XRP and tokens. Cross-currency payments within the XRP Ledger are fully atomic, meaning the payment fully executes or no part of the payment executes at all.

By default, cross-currency payments deliver a fixed amount to their destination at a variable cost to their source. Cross-currency payments can also be partial payments that deliver a variable amount within a set sending limit.

Learn about [Cross-currency Payments](cross-currency-payments.html) on the XRP Ledger.
