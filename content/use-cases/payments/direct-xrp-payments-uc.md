# Direct XRP Payments

The basis of any financial system is transferring value. The simplest and most direct method on the XRP Ledger is transferring XRP from one account to another; successful transactions can complete in 8 seconds or less on the ledger.

**Note:** A direct XRP payment transfers funds in one transaction, without intermediary steps. You can only make direct payments when XRP is the currency sent and received.

Learn about [Direct XRP Payments](direct-xrp-payments.html) on the Ledger.

## Use Cases

### Funding Accounts

Any mathematically-valid address can receive an XRP payment, even if the XRP Ledger has no record of that address existing beforehand, as long as the payment delivers enough XRP to meet the minimum [account reserve](../../accounts/reserves.md). If the payment would not deliver enough XRP, it fails. Direct XRP payments are the only way to fund and create an account on the ledger.
