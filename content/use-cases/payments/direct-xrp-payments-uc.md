# Direct XRP Payments

The basis of any financial system is transferring value. The quickest and simplest method on the XRP Ledger are direct XRP payments from one account to another. Unlike other payment methods that require multiple transactions to complete, direct XRP payments require only one and can complete in 8 seconds or less.

**Note:** You can only make direct payments when XRP is the currency sent and received.

## Use Cases

### Funding Accounts

Any mathematically-valid address can receive an XRP payment, even if the XRP Ledger has no record of that address existing beforehand, as long as the payment delivers enough XRP to meet the minimum [account reserve](reserves.html). If the payment would not deliver enough XRP, it fails. Direct XRP payments are the only way to fund and create an account on the ledger.

### XRP to XRP Transactions
